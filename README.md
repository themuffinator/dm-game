# DarkMatter Game
idTech3 game logic modules based on baseq3a.

## Introduction
QUAKE communities have always been fractured as players gravitate towards a certain title. From Q1 to Q3, there are at least 1,500 quality community-made levels - many of which have either not received the acclaim they deserved or are slowly disappearing from online presence.

DarkMatter is a project that will ultimately provide a unified platform for enjoying the classic QUAKE titles in specially-made mods on a robust, high-performing and stable engine. It will be split into engine and game logic modules, and focus on recreating and refining classic QUAKE gameplay experiences for a wider audience. Hundreds of custom-made levels will be given a new lease of life with high-def levelshots, author tags, entity and clipping fixes and detailed map variables to use in filterable map browsers and map cycles.

## Top of the TODO list:
* Initial gametype code rewrite, mission mode basic handling
* Multi-team support
* Entities and items: redo itemlist, adaptive ent handling per game, initial entity support across Q1, Q2, QL
* Weapon slots system
